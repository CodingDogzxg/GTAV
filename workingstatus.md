# Working Status

Here is the list that will compile and work sucessfully

- [x] Can Compile Game
- [x] Tools
  - [x] Rage Script Editor
    - It's working for me but somehow your virtual machine needs to be **Single Core** for script editor to work.   
  - [x] Rag UI and Interface
  - [x] Map Viewer
  - [x] ShortcutMenu 
  - [x] Other Tools 
- [x] Can Compile Game Scripts
- [x] Can Compile Shaders
- [x] Can Compile Tools
   - You need modify some of the tools to compile it.
